# BattleShip

* Visual Studio solution.
* No front end or UI.
* Back end logic for a user.
* C# code for the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
* Spent lot of time crafting the code.
* Implemented as a Event Sourcing (CQRS) pattern.
* Since Web API was needed, added run time loader of a game.
* Since lot time spent in coding, test cases are written around the core logic.
* I feel there are lot of improvements can be done. There might be un-tested code having bugs.
